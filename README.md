## Predictive Modeling Mastery: Splitting, Scaling, and Analysis

### Description
This project explores data preprocessing, one-hot encoding, train/test splitting, linear regression modeling, scaling techniques, and prediction visualization using the Ames Housing Dataset. The objective is to analyze model performance under different preprocessing methods.

### Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains raw data, processed data, and train/test splits.
- **notebooks/**: Step-by-step Jupyter notebooks for reproducible analysis.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for automated data processing and model evaluation.
- **reports/**: Contains project reports and visual results.
- **envs/**: Contains the `.env` file for secure credential management.

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_link>
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open Google Colab or your preferred IDE to execute the notebooks or scripts.

### Requirements
