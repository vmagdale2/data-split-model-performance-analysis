## Notebook Descriptions

### `01_data_preprocessing.ipynb`
- **Purpose:** Data cleaning, transformation, and handling missing values.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Load the Ames Housing dataset
  - Handle missing values, outliers, and apply feature engineering
  - Encode categorical variables and prepare data for splitting

### `02_train_test_split.ipynb`
- **Purpose:** Creating training and testing data splits for model evaluation.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Perform train/test splits using various strategies (e.g., stratified splits)
  - Ensure data integrity for effective model evaluation

### `03_scaling_and_modeling_analysis.ipynb`
- **Purpose:** Scaling data and building regression models for accurate predictions.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Implement different scaling techniques (e.g., MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler)
  - Train multiple regression models
  - Perform error analysis using MAE, RMSE, and R-squared

### `04_fine_tuning.ipynb`
- **Purpose:** Improving model performance through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Perform grid search and random search for optimal model parameters
  - Evaluate performance improvements post-tuning

### `05_visualization.ipynb`
- **Purpose:** Visualizing model performance and extracting insights from the data.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Visualize predicted vs actual values
  - Create meaningful plots to communicate insights effectively

## Best Practices
✅ Follow the recommended order of the notebooks for a structured workflow.  
✅ Document insights and interpretations directly within each notebook.  
✅ Reference the `/data/` folder for input data files and `/scripts/` for utility functions.
